# simple-blockchain
A simple Python project to explore the concepts of blockchain technology. This blockchain follows proof-of-work methodology.  
  
## General concepts:  
1. **genesis**: On init, we create a âœ¨genesis blockâœ¨ (ooooh, fancy). This is our first ever block on the chain. All of the block's information is serialized into a string, encrypted, and stored on the block as a hash. Then, the genesis block is added to the chain (at index zero).
2. **store data**: We tell the chain we want to add data, which is stored as unconfirmed_data until a block can be mined.
3. **mine**: Mining is the process of adding a block to the chain. The following information will be stored on the block:
    * **index**: Increments as each new block is created.  
    * **data**: At the time a block is created, unconfirmed_data will be added to the block. Once the block is added to the chain, we can consider the data confirmed - 100% legit and in the books. ðŸ’ª  
    * **timestamp**: The date/time at which the block was created.  
    * **hash**: This along with previous_hash are what make the blockchain secure. All of the data on the block is encrypted into this hash. In a proof of work system, this data is encrypted in a way that is very computationally heavy. If someone were to tamper with a block on the chain, they would have to recreate the hash of every following block. Since this is so computationally heavy, it is not possible to modify a block, re-compute all following hashes, and still keep up with all legitimate data being added to the blockchain.
    * **previous_hash**: The hash of the previous block on the chain.  
  
## Some of my own questions about blockchain:
**Q**: How do we know the transactions being added are legitimate? Meaning, how do we prevent someone from adding a transaction that says, "Bob gave me 50 BTC" when Bob didn't actually agree to do this?  
**A**: ?  

**Q**: Since blockchains are fully distributed and open source, how do we know someone is executing a legitimate version of the code?  
**A**: ?
